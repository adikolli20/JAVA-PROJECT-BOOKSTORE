# JAVA-PROJECT-BOOKSTORE
This is a project worked in Java (and Java FX). The main idea is to create an application that will be useful in a bookstore. The basic idea of the application is that there are three types of users : admin, librarian and clients where each of them have separate views and functions inside the application. Java fx has been used for visualizing the app.
